r"""What is actually IN `n_bare`, by provenance [bare-provenance].

`ProofSummary.n_bare` counts goal steps with no as-written proposition, and it
used to pool two unrelated things — *bare by construction* (`show ?thesis`,
`also`, `interpret`) and *the scanner found none*.  That pooling is what hid
issue #9(b) for as long as it did: a wrapped statement was booked as bare, where
nobody would look for a scanner fault.

This measured the population so the buckets could be named after what is in it
rather than guessed at, and now REPORTS against the shipped classifier — it
calls `shape.bare_kind` through `Step.bare` rather than keeping a second copy
of the rule, so the probe cannot agree with a classifier the tool does not use.
Each bucket prints real examples, which is what makes a shifted boundary
visible rather than merely a changed number.

    python scripts/probe_bare_provenance.py [ROOT] [--limit=N]

Whole AFP, 2026-08-31:

    883,246 goal steps, 195,733 bare (22.16%)
    construction  173,613  88.70%   `?thesis`, `?case`, `also`, `interpret`
    unfound        11,766   6.01%   `obtain x where` with the statement below
    undelimited    10,354   5.29%   `hence False by simp` — written, unquoted

Session-at-a-time like `shape census`, so memory stays bounded by the largest
session rather than the corpus.  `--limit=N` takes the first N sessions, which
is an ALPHABETICAL PREFIX and not a sample — fine for a shape, never for a rate.
