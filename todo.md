# Todo list

**Open work only.** Ordered by priority (highest first).  Tags are stable
handles for cross-referencing in commits/PRs — and, once an item ships, for
finding it again with `git log --grep`.

Conventions for changing the tool (the CLI contract, verification habits) live
in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- [ ] `[comment-newline]` A `\<comment>` may be separated from its cartouche
      by a newline.  Isabelle's `comment_prefix` allows any blanks between the
      marker and the cartouche it owns, newlines included, so

          shows \<open>\<exists> k. u k = \<emptyset>\<close>
          \<comment>
          \<open>
            This lemma could easily be generalized ...
          \<close>

      is ONE formal comment.  `_MARKER_OPEN_RE` matches marker-plus-cartouche
      as a single token within a line, so the scanner sees a bare `\<comment>`
      and then a separate LIVE cartouche, and charges all the prose to the
      statement above it (`decl_end_line` 9 where the declaration ends at 5).
      Costs 1 record in the whole AFP — Substitutions_Lambda_Free:58 — but the
      fix is confined to one regex and its state machine, and it is half of
      one question rather than a standalone cheap win: see the next item.
      D5 in the Scala port's `dev/DIVERGENCES.md`.

- [ ] `[comment-before-name]` A formal comment BETWEEN a declaration keyword
      and its name makes the name be read out of the comment's prose, and the
      real declaration is then never indexed at all.

          definition                                    -- HOL/UNITY/WFair.thy:35

            \<comment> \<open>This definition specifies conditional fairness.  The rest
                is generic to all forms of fairness. ...\<close>
            transient :: "'a set => 'a program set" where

      is indexed as `is` (from "is generic"), spanning 14..43, and `transient`
      — the constant this file exists to define — is not an entry.  Same shape
      at `HOL/Bali/TypeRel.thy:368`, where `inductive` followed by a comment
      containing "i.e." mints `i`.
      **Cost: 2 records, both in the distribution; 0 in the AFP.**  Measured
      with `scripts/probe_comment_before_name.py`, which reports every entry
      whose name is not a token of the live view near its own declaration.
      The one AFP hit it finds — `C11-FrontEnd/.../C_Appendices:831` — is the
      phantom already filed under `[keyword-scope]`, a different cause.
      **The SAME-LINE form is already fixed**: `_strip_decl_prefix` skips a
      leading `\<comment>` cartouche, so `definition \<comment> \<open>..\<close>
      bar :: ...` parses.  What is unhandled is the comment on a line of its
      own between the keyword and the name — i.e. `_lookahead_name`, which
      reads the first content line below a bare keyword, does not apply the
      same skip.  Check `tests/test_known_failures.py` first: its
      comment-prefixed-name entries may already pin part of this.
      Sibling of `[comment-newline]` and NOT the same bug: there the marker
      and its cartouche are on different lines, here they are on one line and
      the name lookahead reads through them anyway.  Both are the same
      question asked twice — where does a formal comment end — so they are
      worth fixing together, and the fix is in the same lookahead the
      `[marker-decl]` work touched.
      Found while checking the Scala port's D13 claim that `WFair`'s `is` is
      an entry "reported dead and not dead".  It is not: it is a phantom, and
      the 531 `--reach name` callers of it are the `(is "?thesis")` KEYWORD.

- [ ] `[markup-step-model]` Resolve ONE discrepancy, then stop.  On
      `DitherTM`, `PIDE/markup` decodes to 87 `command_span`s each carrying
      the keyword, Isabelle's own **kind** (`thy_goal_stmt` / `qed` /
      `prf_script` / `prf_decl`) and an exact extent — and `query` sees **38
      steps where Isabelle marks 41 proof commands**.  Every `shape` metric
      rests on the step model, and `shape` numbers are research output, so
      three unexplained steps are worth an afternoon.
      `scripts/probe_pide_markup.py` already decodes the markup; the work is
      "explain the three".
      **Deliberately NOT a fixture corpus.**  This replaces the former
      `[markup-oracle]`, which specced a committed, digest-gated,
      release-pinned harvest of `(source, answer)` pairs.  The precedent says
      that is the wrong half: `[export-oracle]` used Isabelle ground truth as
      a **one-time discovery instrument**, shipped eight commits under
      `[declared-names]` (713 unindexed names, 40,741 cited occurrences), and
      was then RETIRED — `git log --grep='\[declared-names\]'`.  Nothing
      standing was kept and nothing needs maintaining.  As `probe(#8)` put it:
      once the oracle says WHAT to look for, the measurement is ordinary
      source scanning at full corpus scale, on a machine with no Isabelle.
      So if this finds a defect: fix it, pin it with a **hand-written**
      fixture (per `CLAUDE.md` — hand-compute the value, then make the code
      match), cite the markup finding in the commit message, and let the probe
      go.  No heap dependency enters `pytest`.

- [ ] `[feature-audit]` Standing critical pass over each subcommand:
      output formats, defaults, and past design choices.  Re-benchmark
      against AWS AutoCorrode's `iq` tool
      (`https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode/blob/main/iq/README.md`)
      to see which of its affordances we still lack.
      Open design questions (the headline comment-search gap, the
      `-n`/`--names` overload, and the `grep` owner-column span are now
      *closed* — see Done):
      - Optional: a comments-/prose-**only** view.  `grep --with-comments`
        is additive (live source *plus* comments); there's no way to see
        *only* the cartouche prose, which is what a PDF-commentary reader
        wants.

- [ ] `[keyword-scope]` The custom-command table is unioned over the whole
      ROOT, which is right for a session and too coarse for a corpus.  Both
      implementations mirror Isabelle's session-wide `Keywords.++`, but with
      the AFP `thys` directory as one root that puts Optics' `alphabet` in
      scope for Formula_Derivatives, whose `sublocale DA < DAs` /
      `alphabet init delta ...` continuation line then reads as a
      declaration.  16 records over 4 entries (Formula_Derivatives,
      MSO_Regex_Equivalence, UTP, Circus), and only when the whole AFP is
      passed as ONE root — each of the four is clean read as its own root.
      Fixing it means scoping the table per session, which changes the parse
      of every custom-command entry, so it belongs with the session model.
      Newly visible rather than newly introduced: before `[keyword-kind-quoted]`
      the quoted-kind bug kept `alphabet` out of the table and hid it.
      A second instance found while measuring [marker-decl]:
      `Isabelle_C/C_Appendices:831` mints a phantom `DEF` whose name is read
      out of a `text` block's prose, because Isabelle_C's `C_export_file` is in
      scope for a theory that never imports it.  Same shape, different session,
      and it shows the cost is not confined to one continuation-line accident.
      D4 in the Scala port's `dev/DIVERGENCES.md`.
      Sibling observation, same shape, deliberately not filed separately
      (D11): the method/attribute table is resolved from whichever declared
      sessions happen to have a BUILT HEAP, so `callers` can answer
      differently on two machines reading identical sources — heap union, the
      committed census union, or the Pure floor, three tables and three
      answers.  It is documented behaviour rather than a defect (CLAUDE.md
      says so), and it does not reproduce here — this machine has no AFP heaps,
      so the default and `ISABELLE_QUERY_NAMESPACE=committed` both answer 1261
      for `callers mono -c`.  Worth knowing before any measurement is quoted
      across machines.

- [ ] `[axiom-untyped]` An `axiomatization` constant with NO type ascription is
      not indexed.

          axiomatization glob_one and glob_inv     -- FOL/ex/.../Locale_Test1:722
            where glob_lone: \<open>prod(glob_one, x) = x\<close>

      indexes `glob_lone` (the axiom) but neither constant.  `_AXIOM_NAME_RE`
      is `([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_']*)\s*:` — it requires a colon, which is why a
      TYPED constant matches (`f :` out of `f :: "nat"`) and an untyped one
      never does.  The split is the type annotation, not the `and`.
      **Cost: 1 command, corpus-wide.**  Measured over the AFP, FOL, ZF and
      HOL/: exactly the one case above, and zero elsewhere.  That is the whole
      argument for leaving it: the colon is what stops the scan matching
      `where`, `and`, and any word in a proposition, and relaxing it to catch
      one declaration risks the over-match it was written to prevent.
      What would make it worth doing is a narrower rule rather than a looser
      one — before `where`, on the command's own lines, a bare `NAME (and
      NAME)*` list IS a constant list — which is a small grammar of its own,
      not a regex tweak.  Split out of `[axiom-names]`, whose other half
      shipped; the two turned out not to share a scan after all (the phantom
      was an unconditional placeholder, not a missing lookahead).

- [ ] `[grep-plain]` Optional `--plain`/`--raw` override on `grep`:
      force plain line-grep (no entry/comment parsing) instead of the
      `infer` parse policy.  Post-routing-refactor the parse mode is an
      explicit per-command property (`_section_from`'s `parse` arg):
      `largest`/`sorry` are `"syntax"`, `grep` is `"infer"` (decide per
      source from the `.thy` suffix, stdin defaulting to syntax-aware).
      This flag would let `grep` take a third value, `"plain"`, forcing
      plain line-grep — useful to override the suffix-less stdin guess
      (`git show REF:notes.md | query grep PAT - --plain`) or the rare
      on-disk case (a `.thy` grepped as raw text, or a theory under another
      extension).  Default stays `"infer"`.  Add the flag through one shared
      helper per the CLI contract.  Scope: `grep` only — `lines` is already
      ignore-syntax (a parse flag is inert) and `largest`/`sorry` *are* the
      entry view (plain guts them), so this is **not** a uniform
      all-commands flag.  Low urgency: `"infer"` parsing of non-theory
      content already degrades gracefully (every line reads as live, so all
      matches still show; only the owner column goes `—`).

- [ ] `[countstr]` **(exploratory — shape not settled).**  Record the itch,
      not a design.  The need: before a multi-site rewrite (a `replace_all`,
      a `sed`-style sweep), verify *exactly* how many times an exact,
      usually **multi-line** literal block occurs in a file, so the edit's
      reach is known up front — the "inventory the whole match set before
      claiming 'all instances'" discipline applied to a literal block.
      Today this needs an ad-hoc `python3 -c` count (or a throwaway script),
      which is precisely the gate-tripping shell the tool exists to retire.
      Why the shape feels off — the open tensions, all unresolved:
        - **Scope creep.**  `query` is theory-aware (entries, call graphs,
          syntax slices); a raw literal counter is generic text counting,
          nearer `grep -Fc` than anything semantic.  Does it belong here at
          all, or is reaching for `query` over `grep` here a category error?
        - **Not line-count.**  `grep -c` (and the planned `[grep-plain]`)
          count matching *lines*; the whole point is a *multi-line* block as
          one unit, which line-grep structurally can't express.  So this is a
          genuinely new counting mode, not a flag on existing `-c`.
        - **Literal vs regex.**  The `replace_all` use is *fixed-string*
          (exact block, no metachar surprises) — so `-F`/`--fixed`, not the
          regex `grep` takes.  A multi-line *regex* count is a different,
          slipperier beast; conflating them is part of why the shape wobbles.
        - **Input ergonomics (the worst part).**  Supplying a multi-line
          literal on argv is miserable; via stdin (`query countstr FILE -` /
          `< block`) the `-`/stdin sentinel is already the *file* side
          (`[stdin-path]`), so block-on-stdin + file-on-disk collide.  This
          tension is the main reason it isn't ready.
      Tentative leaning (do NOT build yet): a `--fixed`/`-F` + `--count`
      multiline mode on `grep` rather than a new verb — but only once the
      block-input ergonomics are solved.  Low value / low urgency: an inline
      one-liner covers it today; this is about retiring that one-liner, not
      unblocking anything.

- [ ] `[doc-graph]` **(exploratory — scope-uncertain.)**  A reference
      graph + activity survey over a project's **prose documentation**
      (design memos, spec docs, decision records) — the complement of the
      theory-entry graph.  As an Isabelle/Isar project accretes design
      docs, you periodically need to know which docs are stale
      (last-touched, commit churn) and which are actually referenced — and
      critically, *from where*.  Load-bearing lesson: a doc's real
      coupling often lives **outside the
      prose** — a `ROOT` description, a `.thy` `\<comment>`, a sibling
      test-harness's relative link — so a markdown-only "who cites this?"
      scan undercounts; the citer scan must span the whole tracked tree.
      Concrete prototype: a `doc-audit.py` — two modes, a per-file
      table (LASTCOMMIT / commit-count / lines / REF-A [cites from the
      active steering docs] / REF-ALL [cites anywhere in the tree]) and a
      `--refs FILE` location dump (`path:line`).
      Scope tension (same flavour as `[countstr]`): `query` is
      theory-aware (entries, call graphs, syntax slices over `.thy` under
      the `.isabelle-query` root); a doc-reference graph is generic prose
      over arbitrary files, nearer `grep -rl` + `git log` than anything
      semantic.  Does it belong in `query` at all, or is the doc corpus a
      sibling tool's job?  Two sub-questions if it lands here: (a) the
      citer scan wants the *whole* repo, which breaks the `t/`-only
      `.isabelle-query` scoping; (b) it shares machinery with the shipped
      `graph` verb (serialise an adjacency) and `refs` (citation rollup)
      but over a different node set (files, not entries).  Record the
      need; don't build until the scope call is made.
