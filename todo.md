# Todo list

**Open work only.** Ordered by priority (highest first).  Tags are stable
handles for cross-referencing in commits/PRs — and, once an item ships, for
finding it again with `git log --grep`.

Conventions for changing the tool (the CLI contract, verification habits) live
in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- [ ] `[bare-provenance]` Split `n_bare` by *why* a goal step has no
      proposition.  It pools two unrelated things — **bare by construction**
      (`show ?thesis`, `also`, `case`, `interpret`) and **the scanner found
      none** — and that pooling is what hid issue #9(b) for as long as it did:
      a wrapped statement was booked as bare, where nobody would look for a
      scanner fault.  Suggested by the issue itself (its item 3, marked
      optional) and left out of the fix because it changes the emitted record,
      not just the numbers in it.  Two consequences worth having: a rise in
      `n_bare` becomes interpretable as a fact about writing style rather than
      possibly about the scanner, and the residue the narrow (b) rule leaves —
      `obtain x where` on its own line, which is still booked bare — becomes
      *countable* instead of invisible, which is the prerequisite for deciding
      whether to widen the lookahead.  Land it as a new field, not a
      redefinition of `n_bare`, so stored census rows stay comparable.

- [ ] `[count-mode-zero]` `-c` / `--count` prints a sentence, not a count,
      when nothing matches: `find zzz -c` says `No entries matching 'zzz'.`
      where a count mode should say `0`.  The sentence is emitted by
      `render._emit_matches`'s empty guard, which runs *before* the mode
      dispatch, so every verb funnelling through it (`find`, `show`) is
      affected.  Small, but it is the difference between `$(query find X -c)`
      being arithmetic and being a parse error — and the empty case is the
      one a script most wants to branch on.  Check the other count paths at
      the same time (`refs`, `callers`, `callees`, `methods`) rather than
      fixing one: whether they agree is not currently pinned anywhere.

- [ ] `[disambig-names]` AFP-scale output qualifies theory names by the
      **minimal distinguishing path**.  `query largest` (and any verb that
      prints a bare theory name) currently strips both `.thy` and the
      dirname, so across the AFP's thousands of theories the result is a
      wall of unqualified `Bla` / `Foo` — collisions with no way to tell
      `ae/Bla` from `ar/Bla`.  Show just enough *leading* path to make each
      printed name unique within the result set — `ae/Bla`, `ar/Foo` — but
      not the shared root prefix (`t/ae/Bla`).  Compute the shortest path
      suffix unique among the names actually shown, so a single-session run
      stays bare `Bla` and only genuine collisions grow a prefix.  Lands on
      `largest` first.  Deeper than cosmetics: it is a prerequisite for the
      `theory:line` **round-trip** convention (see `[locus-roundtrip]`) — a
      bare `Bla:11` locus is unresolvable when two `Bla`s exist, so the
      emitter must qualify the name far enough for the resolver to round it
      back to one theory.

- [ ] `[markup-oracle]` Ground truth for **spans and the step model**, from
      `PIDE/markup` in a built session database.  The #8 entity export gives
      names and a *name* position (`offset..end_offset` brackets the name, not
      the declaration), so declaration extents, command segmentation and
      comment regions — what `parsing.scan_regions` actually computes, and
      what `enclosing`/`outline`/`largest` and every `shape` metric rest on —
      have no oracle at all.  `PIDE/markup` is the theory text with Isabelle's
      markup interleaved: on `DitherTM` it decodes to 87 `command_span`s, each
      carrying the keyword, Isabelle's own **kind** and an exact extent
      (`definition 66..68`, `lemma 74..74`, `by 75..75`).  The kind field
      (`thy_goal_stmt` / `qed` / `prf_script` / `prf_decl`) is Isabelle's own
      version of the goal / closing / plumbing split `shape` builds by hand —
      on that theory `query` sees 38 steps where Isabelle marks 41 proof
      commands, which is a checkable discrepancy nothing currently checks.
      `scripts/probe_pide_markup.py` already decodes it.
      **Build it as a fixture generator, not a reference.**  A heap is a
      snapshot; comparing today's parse against it live would ossify, and the
      only cure for a stale reference is a rebuild — the one thing this tool
      must never do.  `isabelle_sources` carries a plain SHA-1 digest and the
      compressed body of every source consumed, so (a) staleness is *decided*
      — gate every comparison on the digest and skip a moved theory with a
      reason, never as a disagreement — and (b) the snapshot contains its own
      inputs, so a `(source, answer)` pair harvested from it stays
      self-consistent forever and replays with **no Isabelle installed**.
      That is what gets these checks into `pytest` instead of a heap-dependent
      `make` target, and it is why building more heaps is worth it: the cost
      is paid once and the artifact is permanent.  Two constraints when
      harvesting: commit minimal extracted snippets, not whole AFP files
      (licensing and size), and record the Isabelle release in the fixture,
      since it pins that release's semantics.

- [ ] `[feature-audit]` Standing critical pass over each subcommand:
      output formats, defaults, and past design choices.  Re-benchmark
      against AWS AutoCorrode's `iq` tool
      (`https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode/blob/main/iq/README.md`)
      to see which of its affordances we still lack.
      Open design questions (the headline comment-search gap, the
      `-n`/`--names` overload, and the `grep` owner-column span are now
      *closed* — see Done):
      - Optional: a comments-/prose-**only** view.  `grep --with-comments`
        is additive (live source *plus* comments); there's no way to see
        *only* the cartouche prose, which is what a PDF-commentary reader
        wants.

- [ ] `[grep-plain]` Optional `--plain`/`--raw` override on `grep`:
      force plain line-grep (no entry/comment parsing) instead of the
      `infer` parse policy.  Post-routing-refactor the parse mode is an
      explicit per-command property (`_section_from`'s `parse` arg):
      `largest`/`sorry` are `"syntax"`, `grep` is `"infer"` (decide per
      source from the `.thy` suffix, stdin defaulting to syntax-aware).
      This flag would let `grep` take a third value, `"plain"`, forcing
      plain line-grep — useful to override the suffix-less stdin guess
      (`git show REF:notes.md | query grep PAT - --plain`) or the rare
      on-disk case (a `.thy` grepped as raw text, or a theory under another
      extension).  Default stays `"infer"`.  Add the flag through one shared
      helper per the CLI contract.  Scope: `grep` only — `lines` is already
      ignore-syntax (a parse flag is inert) and `largest`/`sorry` *are* the
      entry view (plain guts them), so this is **not** a uniform
      all-commands flag.  Low urgency: `"infer"` parsing of non-theory
      content already degrades gracefully (every line reads as live, so all
      matches still show; only the owner column goes `—`).

- [ ] `[countstr]` **(exploratory — shape not settled).**  Record the itch,
      not a design.  The need: before a multi-site rewrite (a `replace_all`,
      a `sed`-style sweep), verify *exactly* how many times an exact,
      usually **multi-line** literal block occurs in a file, so the edit's
      reach is known up front — the "inventory the whole match set before
      claiming 'all instances'" discipline applied to a literal block.
      Today this needs an ad-hoc `python3 -c` count (or a throwaway script),
      which is precisely the gate-tripping shell the tool exists to retire.
      Why the shape feels off — the open tensions, all unresolved:
        - **Scope creep.**  `query` is theory-aware (entries, call graphs,
          syntax slices); a raw literal counter is generic text counting,
          nearer `grep -Fc` than anything semantic.  Does it belong here at
          all, or is reaching for `query` over `grep` here a category error?
        - **Not line-count.**  `grep -c` (and the planned `[grep-plain]`)
          count matching *lines*; the whole point is a *multi-line* block as
          one unit, which line-grep structurally can't express.  So this is a
          genuinely new counting mode, not a flag on existing `-c`.
        - **Literal vs regex.**  The `replace_all` use is *fixed-string*
          (exact block, no metachar surprises) — so `-F`/`--fixed`, not the
          regex `grep` takes.  A multi-line *regex* count is a different,
          slipperier beast; conflating them is part of why the shape wobbles.
        - **Input ergonomics (the worst part).**  Supplying a multi-line
          literal on argv is miserable; via stdin (`query countstr FILE -` /
          `< block`) the `-`/stdin sentinel is already the *file* side
          (`[stdin-path]`), so block-on-stdin + file-on-disk collide.  This
          tension is the main reason it isn't ready.
      Tentative leaning (do NOT build yet): a `--fixed`/`-F` + `--count`
      multiline mode on `grep` rather than a new verb — but only once the
      block-input ergonomics are solved.  Low value / low urgency: an inline
      one-liner covers it today; this is about retiring that one-liner, not
      unblocking anything.

- [ ] `[doc-graph]` **(exploratory — scope-uncertain.)**  A reference
      graph + activity survey over a project's **prose documentation**
      (design memos, spec docs, decision records) — the complement of the
      theory-entry graph.  As an Isabelle/Isar project accretes design
      docs, you periodically need to know which docs are stale
      (last-touched, commit churn) and which are actually referenced — and
      critically, *from where*.  Load-bearing lesson: a doc's real
      coupling often lives **outside the
      prose** — a `ROOT` description, a `.thy` `\<comment>`, a sibling
      test-harness's relative link — so a markdown-only "who cites this?"
      scan undercounts; the citer scan must span the whole tracked tree.
      Concrete prototype: a `doc-audit.py` — two modes, a per-file
      table (LASTCOMMIT / commit-count / lines / REF-A [cites from the
      active steering docs] / REF-ALL [cites anywhere in the tree]) and a
      `--refs FILE` location dump (`path:line`).
      Scope tension (same flavour as `[countstr]`): `query` is
      theory-aware (entries, call graphs, syntax slices over `.thy` under
      the `.isabelle-query` root); a doc-reference graph is generic prose
      over arbitrary files, nearer `grep -rl` + `git log` than anything
      semantic.  Does it belong in `query` at all, or is the doc corpus a
      sibling tool's job?  Two sub-questions if it lands here: (a) the
      citer scan wants the *whole* repo, which breaks the `t/`-only
      `.isabelle-query` scoping; (b) it shares machinery with the shipped
      `graph` verb (serialise an adjacency) and `refs` (citation rollup)
      but over a different node set (files, not entries).  Record the
      need; don't build until the scope call is made.

## Open work from the Scala rewrite

These three are recorded in `dev/P7-STATUS.md` with their evidence; the entries
here are the handles.

- [ ] `[namespace-by-value]` Thread the method/attribute table through as a
      **value** instead of binding `isabelle.query.Namespace`'s process-global
      state.  It decides whether `auto` is a proof method or a fact, and every
      resident host has had to work around it separately: the jEdit plugin
      serialises all engine calls through one worker thread, and the warm
      server restores the committed default before every request under one
      lock.  Both are correct and both cost the same thing — **no two projects
      can be queried at once in one JVM**.  The fix changes the signature of
      every analysis in `usage_graph`, `usage` and `shape`, so it needs the
      full differential matrix plus both probes, not a spot check.  Removing
      the lock is the only thing that lifts the server's throughput ceiling.

- [ ] `[regex-dialect]` D12: `\w` is `java.util.regex`'s here and Python's in
      the oracle, so `²`/`½` are word characters to the oracle and not to us,
      and a combining mark is one to us and not to it.  One record differs
      across the whole AFP (`Feuerbach/special`, two derived count fields).
      The fix is a translation layer in `Py.compile` — `\w` → `[\p{L}\p{N}_]`,
      `\W` its complement, `\s` to Python's whitespace set (which also
      differs), and `\b` as explicit lookarounds because Java derives it from
      its own `\w`.  It sits under the deepest lexical primitive in the engine,
      so it changes what a NAME is, what `grep` matches and what the call graph
      sees: it needs the P1 entry-set gate re-run over both corpora, not just
      the difftest.  Evidence in `dev/DIVERGENCES.md` §D12.

- [ ] `[client-console-name]` The warm client has no console name — it is
      invoked as `python3 query_base/lib/scripts/query_client.py`.  Giving it
      the `query` name (a `lib/Tools/` script, or an alias) would make it a
      drop-in for the Python tool, which is what `PLAN.md` §P7 anticipated.
      Deliberately not taken: it decides what `query` means on a user's PATH,
      and that is an installer's call, not the component's.

## Done

Nothing — by design. Completed work is recorded in its commit messages, which
carry the reasoning, the rejected alternatives and the before/after, and cannot
drift from the code the way a summary of them can. Recover one by its tag:

    git log --grep='\[locus-roundtrip\]'
