r"""Proofs written on the goal statement's own line (issue #5).

`lemma a: "P" by simp` and the same proof written on the next line are the same
proof, and must produce the same shape record.  They did not: `_scan_steps` read
the shared line from column 0, `_command_prefix` cut it at the statement's first
quote, and the resulting `lemma a: ` led no step family — so the scan returned
no steps, `analyze_proof` returned None, and the entry left the census entirely.
Because the spelling is preferred for *trivial* proofs, the loss biased every
aggregate rather than thinning it evenly: 1,870 proofs over 120 AFP entries.

Three spellings put a proof on a statement line, and they need different
evidence to recognise (see `shape._inline_proof_col`), so each is pinned here:
the declaration line, a later line of a multi-line declaration, and a bare
statement term past `decl_end_line`.  The equivalence tests are written against
the OTHER spelling rather than against literal expected values, since "the two
spellings agree" is the property that matters and it cannot drift.

What is NOT pinned here, deliberately: the two statement-text guards inside
`_inline_proof_col`.  They are unreachable on real sources (0 of 43,828 AFP
proofs take a different column without them), so no fixture can exercise them —
a test asserting otherwise would be testing a case Isar does not produce.  The
guards exist to keep a future `parsing` change from turning a step into a mask,
and that is stated in the function, not simulated here.
