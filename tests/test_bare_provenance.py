r"""Why a goal step has no proposition, not just that it hasn't [bare-provenance].

`n_bare` pooled two unrelated things — *bare by construction* (`show ?thesis`,
`also`, `interpret`) and *the scanner found none* — and that pooling is what hid
issue #9(b) for as long as it did: a wrapped statement was booked as bare, where
nobody would look for a scanner fault.  So a rise in `n_bare` could not be read
as evidence about anything.

`bare_kinds` splits it three ways, and the buckets are named after the measured
population rather than guessed at — `scripts/probe_bare_provenance.py` over the
whole AFP, 195,733 bare goal steps out of 883,246:

    construction   173,613   88.70%   `?thesis`, `?case`, `also`, `interpret`
    unfound         11,766    6.01%   `obtain x where` with the statement below
    undelimited     10,354    5.29%   `hence False by simp` — written, unquoted

The third bucket is the one measuring found rather than confirmed: the
proposition IS on the line, written without quotes or a cartouche, which Isar
allows for a single term.  Nobody had counted those.

`unfound` is the residue and the point of the split — the only bucket whose
growth is evidence about the SCANNER rather than about writing style.

`n_bare` is unchanged and is the sum, so a stored census row stays comparable
with a new one.  `TheSumIsStillNBare` is the guard for that, and it is the one
that matters: a refinement that quietly redefines the field it refines would
invalidate every row already on disk.
