r"""Goal steps the step scanner used to lose (issue #9).

Both faults came from one assumption in `shape._scan_steps`: that a proof line
is `command prefix` + *one* proposition, where the prefix ends at the line's
first `"` / `\<open>`.  Neither raised nor warned; each just produced a record
with a smaller number in it, which is the failure mode a metric tool has to be
most afraid of.

  (a) `from \<open>P\<close> have "Q"` — the cartouche is a *fact reference* in
      command position, so truncating there hid the `have` and the line booked
      as `plumbing`.  2.68% of AFP goal steps.
  (b) a proposition wrapped to the next line was discarded and the goal
      recorded as bare.  1.43% of goal steps, and 6.2% of everything reported
      in `n_bare`.

Each fixture below is written as the issue wrote it: the triggering shape, then
**the identical proof without it**.  Asserting fault == control is what makes
these regression tests rather than descriptions — it pins the property (the
spelling must not change the measurement), so it keeps holding if the numbers
themselves legitimately change.

(a) is worth separating from the module docstring's general "line-anchored,
undercounts multi-*statement* lines" caveat, because the affected spelling is
specifically *modern* Isar: `from p have` and the backtick form were never
affected.  The undercount therefore grew as a development adopted current
style, so a measurement compared across releases saw a scanner artifact moving
in the same direction as the style trend.
