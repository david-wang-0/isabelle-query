r"""A count mode prints a NUMBER, including when the answer is zero.

`find zzz -c` printed `No entries matching 'zzz'.` where a count mode should
print `0`.  The sentence came from `render._emit_matches`'s empty guard, which
ran *before* the mode dispatch, so every verb funnelling through it (`find`,
`show`) was affected; `unused` had the same shape in `_render_unused`.

Small, and the difference between `$(query find X -c)` being arithmetic and
being a parse error — and the empty case is the one a script most wants to
branch on, so it was wrong exactly where it mattered most.

**The agreement between verbs is what this file really pins**, because that is
what was never checked anywhere.  `scripts/probe_count_modes.py` asks all of
them at once; this is the same question as a test.  There are two kinds of
empty and they are not the same answer:

* **zero** — the answer really is zero (`find`, `show`, `grep`, `unused`,
  `sorry`, and `callers`, which SCANS source and can truthfully report zero
  mentions of any token).  A number is the only right output.
* **unknown** — the SUBJECT does not exist, so the question could not be asked
  (`callees`, `refs`, `methods`).  Printing `0` there would be the silent zero
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` forbids: a caller cannot tell a broken run from a real one.
  These keep their diagnostic.  That they print it on *stdout* and exit *0* is
  a separate defect, filed as `[unresolved-subject]`.

`--names` gets the same treatment as `--count` and for the same reason: an
empty list is the right answer for a pipeline, and a sentence on stdout would
be read as a name.

    `callees zzz` cannot be answered without an entry called `zzz`.  Reporting
